Weather Dashboard


The purpose of this homework is to create a weather dashboard with an Api key.
You first need to create a personal API key on this website https://home.openweathermap.org/home.
Then you also need to modify the URL in order to place the latitude, longitude, and the name of the city the user will search.


In the weather dashbord you have to display the weather of a certain city but also its humidity and wind ratios.
Moreover you must create a forecast function in order to display the weather in a particular place for the next 5 days.

Finally you need to display also the past searches of the user.
